"Modeling and Predicting Metropolitan Sprawl" is a science fair project employing advanced machine learning and data science techniques to address the pressing and continual challenge of urban sprawl. Inspired by Atlanta’s infamous issue, this project aims to provide valuable insights and tools for local urban planners to make informed decisions about sustainable city development for the improvement of communities around us. Through the utilization of predictive AI, innovative visualizations, and comprehensive data analysis, this research aims to better  the societal understanding of metropolitan sprawl’s dynamics.
Our project utilizes vital machine learning algorithms to analyze historical urban development data and identify the key factors contributing to the uncontrolled expansion of metropolitan areas. The incorporation of multiple metrics and diverse geodata such as population trends, land use changes, forestry, soil erosion, and infrastructure, allows for a holistic perspective on the urbanization process.
The outcomes of our ongoing research process are being documented in a blog and this research paper. We aim to aid urban planners with actionable insights, which in turn facilitates evidence-based decision-making for the development and implementation of effective urban policies. Our project not only contributes to the scientific understanding of Atlanta’s metropolitan sprawl, but also offers practical solutions to the challenges posed by rapid urbanization in the 21st century.
