The Data Metropolis: Navigating Urban Growth Through Machine Learning

“The Data Metropolis,” is a science fair project that aspires to better the understanding of this question: How do different factors drive the dynamics of the urban ecosystem? Inspired by Atlanta, the AP Human Geography poster-child of urban sprawl, the project aims to provide valuable insights surrounding geodata, population, and finance to make informed decisions about sustainable city development for the improvement of many businesses, companies, and communities. Through the utilization of regressive machine learning, innovative visualizations, and comprehensive statistical analysis, this research aims to better the societal understanding of the metropolitan landscape.

The regression model analyzes a combination of demographic, population, and financial data to predict zip codes at risk for sprawl. Beforehand, it was hypothesized that multiple metrics and diverse geodata such as population trends, land use changes, forestry, soil erosion, and infrastructure, would influence predictions. The visualization and modeling of many factors ultimately allowed for a holistic perspective on the urbanization process, and acted as a jump start for research in a worldwide phenomena to be applied in the United States.

The exact outcomes of the project are documented in its research paper. This research delves specifically into the finding relationships among various factors and population growth. Future project developments would seek to include more elements perhaps in an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can find subtle relationships among variables. An overarching goal stands to aid urban planners, real estate developers, and businesses with actionable insights which can hopefully nurture the implementation of effective, environmental urban policies to face the challenges posed by rapid urbanization of the 21st century.
